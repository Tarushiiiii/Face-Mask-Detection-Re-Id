# 🧠 FACE MASK DETECTION + PERSON RE-IDENTIFICATION

### **A Dual-Module Computer Vision System**

This project contains _two independent deep learning pipelines_:

1. **Face Mask Detection**
2. **Person Re-Identification (Re-ID)**

Both systems are modular, standalone, and can be executed separately.

# 🌟 1. Face Mask Detection

A deep-learning system that detects faces from images/video streams and classifies whether the person is **wearing a mask** or **not wearing a mask**.

## ✔ Features

- Face detection using OpenCV
- Mask vs No Mask classifier
- Real-time video & webcam support
- Script for single-image prediction
- Trained `mask_detector.model`
